# Installation

?> Since **v7** `playwright-bdd` does not depend on `@cucumber/cucumber`

Install `playwright-bdd` from npm:

```
npm i -D playwright-bdd
```

This package uses `@playwright/test` as a peer dependency. Minimal Playwright version is **1.35**.

If you update Playwright version, you may need to [install browsers](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers):

```
npx playwright install
```
